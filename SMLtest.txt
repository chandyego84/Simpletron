Test SML programs:
1) Use sentinel-controlled loop to read positive numbers and compute and display
their sum. Terminate input when a negative number is entered.
00 +1008 Read first positive number to 08
01 +2008 Load first positive number to accumulator
02 +4111 Branch negative to 11
03 +1009 Read subsequent positive numbers to 09
04 +4111 Branch negative to 11
05 +3009 Add positive number to accumulator
06 +2110 Store accumulator to 10
07 +4003 Branch (loop) to 03
08 +0000 First Variable A
09 +0000 Subsequrent Variable B
10 +0000 Sum Variable C
11 +1110 Display sum (10)
12 +4300 Halt program

2) Use a counter-controlled loop to read seven numbers, some positive and some negative, and compute
and display their average.
00 +1015 Read integer to 15
01 +2016 Load the sum from 16 --> accumulator
02 +3015 Add intger from 15 to accumulator
03 +2116 Store the sum to 16
04 +2013 Load current counter from 13 --> accumulator
05 +3114 Decrement current counter (accumulator) by 1
06 +4208 Branchzero to calculate division 
07 +4000 Branch to read integer again (LOOP)
08 +2012 Load initial counter (7) to accumulator
09 +3216 Divide sum into accumulator (calculate average)
10 +2117 Store the average to 17
11 +1117 Display the average to screen
12 +0007 Initial Counter Variable (7)
13 +0007 Current Counter Variable (7) to be decremented
14 +0001 Decrement Amount (1)
15 +0000 Integer Variable
16 +0000 Sum Variable
17 +0000 Average Variable
18 +4300 Halt program

3) Read a series of numbers, and determine and display the largest number.
The first number read indicates how many numbers should be processed.
00 +1015 Read processing integer (counter)
01 +1016 Read number to current number
02 +2017 Load current largest number
03 +3116 Subtract current number from current largest number
04 +4106 Branch Negative
05 +4009 Branch to check if counter == 0
06 +2016 Load current number
07 +2117 Store current number as new largest number
08 +4009 Branch to check if counter == 0
09 +2015 Load current counter 
10 +4212 Branch zero; stop reading 
11 +4001 Branch to read next number
12 +2017 Load largest number
13 +1117 Display largest number
14 +4300 Halt program
15 +0000 Counter Variable
16 +0000 Number Variable
17 +0000 Largest Number Variable
